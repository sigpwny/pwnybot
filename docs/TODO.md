# Stuff to do (In order of importance)
1. Get translate.py working on demo.py, see if it can then propogate to something more complicated.
    1. This would be huge if it actually worked
2. Get dockerfile working, ensure it works
3. Move load, unload, help, and pwnyBot management commands over to official discord slash commands! 
4. Work on isolatedrun.py (so people who are developing can develop with proper semantics)
