0,"emacs","Using eMacs actually has nothing to do with productivity. In fact, I’m not even trying to optimize it. I simply think it’s a good tool for keeping me organized. Why do some people live their life in a constant state of disarray, rushing from place to place, never knowing what they need to do besides their immediate task, constantly worrying about their deadlines when they can instead live in peace? Emacs is one of the many tools I use to organize my life, to take my mind off the things that don’t matter and let a machine remember for me. I live knowing that, at the end of the day, everything will be ok. There’s nothing urgent that needs to be on my mind because I have written it down for thought later. Emacs is not about productivity. Emacs is about organization, a system I can tune to my needs, so that I can live a stress-free, fulfilling life. - Richard"
