# pwnyBot
SIGPwny discord bot repository for security and security related bots

# Features
## pwnyBot discord bot
pwnyBot is a discord bot aggregator which can dynamically load different Discord bots under a single user.
## Bot Translation
Translates bots from standard discord.py extension into a discord.ext commands compatible file.
This is a rudimentary system, you need to write the bot relatively in a standard way.
## Isolated Run
isolatedrun.py allows you to develop a pwnyBot bot as a cog file, so it can run on its own. 
When you are done testing it independently, you can take the bot file and add it to `/src/bots` and pwnyBot will accept it without issue
